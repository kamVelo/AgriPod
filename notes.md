# Issues with index.html

- The use of `vh` for font sizes and such is problematic as it doesn't allow a user to zoom out of your site.
- You should know that you cannot use a transition property to transition between backgrounds. This has been ammended by using pure CSS.
- The awards section has been changed to support (most) screen sizes.
- The first section of the page with the video has been changed in HTML and CSS to make the CSS simpler.
- The finance section has been changed to simplify the HTML.
